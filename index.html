        <h2>About Self</h2>
        <p> A young man, looking to accomplish more everyday. I strive to continue learning and teaching my community and peers to 
            not only better ourselves, but others as well. Currently I spend many days thinking of solving new and exciting problems
             along with how to make solutions by finding new ways to combine already known solutions. Beyond work, I love to be part
              of my community and enjoy doing small projects from helping the homeless, to supporting and helping the growth and 
              education of our future generations. When I am lounging about, one can find me reading, writing for small prompts, 
              socializing with friends, working out, or playing games with friends.</p>

        <h2> What I Bring to the "Table"</h2>
        <p> I bring creativity driven development and an interest in creating "art" through new ways to combine what is already used
             and created. Sometimes, a look at what cogs can fit together is needed to understand that two machines can create a new 
             one in larger pictures. Besides creative interest, I am team orientated and goal motivated. Our team takes priority and 
             making sure everyone understands our tasks and has a voice in the project. I excel in leadership and will always be more 
             than willing to take the reins and help lead a team through uncertainty, or even help hold the reins for team members 
             wishing to improve their own leadership skills or needing advice.

    <h2>Goals</h2>
        <h3>Work Related</h3>
            <p> My current work related goals are to become more familiar with the software industry and what needs are being 
                requested for database and pattern recognition or search algorithms. Within the next 3 to 5 years, I would like 
                to become well versed in the market demands and improve my overall skills in legacy code, and large-scale team 
                projects.
            </p>
        <h3>Life Related</h3>
            <p> My current life related goals are to continue improving myself at the gym through weight training and to continue 
                expressing myself through different arts. I plan on doing these goals in the next couple of years by continuing 
                guitar lessons and picking up either piano or dancing lessons. I also have in mind ideas for short story writing 
                and other types of writings I would love to share with others. Within the next 3 years I would like to become 
                proficient with the guitar and either learn more classical dances or become proficient with the piano.
